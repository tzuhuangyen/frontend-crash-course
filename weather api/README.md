# API-openweather-search
The code is a JavaScript program that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specified location and display it on a webpage. The program uses the  `fetch`  method to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with a specified URL that includes the location and API key. 
 Once the response is received, the program uses the  `JSON.parse`  method to convert the response data from a JSON string to a JavaScript object. The program then calls the  `displayWeather`  function with the parsed data as an argument. 
 The  `displayWeather`  function retrieves specific data from the parsed object, such as the city name, country, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The function then uses the  `querySelector`  method to select specific HTML elements on the webpage and set their  `innerText`  property to the corresponding weather data. 
 The function also sets the  `src`  property of the weather icon element to the URL of the weather icon from the OpenWeatherMap API. The function removes the  `loading`  class from the weather element to display the weather data on the webpage. The function also sets the background image of the webpage to a random image from the Unsplash API that matches the city name. 
 Overall, the code is a simple implementation of the OpenWeatherMap API that retrieves and displays weather data for a specified location on a webpage.
